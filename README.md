### A simple IceWM Theme

### Installation
Requires: IceWM, Terminus font (Make sure you get the XFT variant)

- Use the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/mxrgann/voyd.git
```
- Place resulting folder inside of /usr/share/icewm/themes/


The start button was made with Arch in mind, but I will hopefully redo it and make a template for to make other distros into a start button.
